I had big plans for this website, I had dreams of posting a lot of content, information which I thought would help a lot of people and reach a big audience. It's  been more than 6 months since I set up this blog and not once I came here to post  anything. Of course I had a lot of content planned out(almost 5 tech related blog topics lined up)  but some things just seem to slip out and I find no time to look at it again. I took the  time today to just talk about what's going on in my life, something of a journal. </p> <p>At the start of 2024, I had so many projects I wanted to start working on and so many projects  I wanted to continue working on, just like this one. My new year resolution was to be consistent  on things I do and keep improving my skills. But then I started to realise that there's so  many other things in life I'm seriously lacking in. I have addictions I want to stop, I have documents  and life stuff like just getting a regular health checkup, I have family members I want to call,  I have friends I want to hang out with more. Its mid February and I still haven't done any of anything  I promised myself I would do.</p> <p>You might ask, what am I actually doing all day then? Its simple. I try to avoid doing all of the things  that I've decided I want to do and do everything else that's not on my list. I don't know how many people  relate to this but once I put some pressure and try to force myself to do something, it never ever ever  works. EVER. I never touch the task again unless I have deadlines. You could tell that all the tasks I  mentioned above do not have deadlines and it's up to me to do it. </p> <p>I'm writing this blog not as a sign to show that I've figured out the solution to all my problems and  I'm finally consistent and I'm doing everything perfectly. I've started writing this just as a start to put some extra efforts to do the things I like to do. I figured that it would be easier for me  to start this blog as a journal and to talk about myself and update my progress rather than jump into all  the dreams I had for this blog. </p> <p>FYI, my english might be bad here but I DID NOT USE CHATGPT TO WRITE THIS. Adios</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022/01/31/hello-world/","title":"Hello world!","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque nec maximus ex.
