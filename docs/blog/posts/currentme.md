# Just Another Day

Hey everyone! I had big plans for this website, I had dreams of posting a lot of content,
information which I thought would help a lot of people and reach a big audience. It's 
been more than 6 months since I set up this blog and not once I came here to post 
anything. Of course I had a lot of content planned out(almost 5 tech related blog topics lined up) 
but some things just seem to slip out and I find no time to look at it again. I took the 
time today to just talk about what's going on in my life, something of a journal. 

<!-- more -->

At the start of 2024, I had so many projects I wanted to start working on and so many projects 
I wanted to continue working on, just like this one. My new year resolution was to be consistent 
on things I do and keep improving my skills. But then I started to realise that there's so 
many other things in life I'm seriously lacking in. I have addictions I want to stop, I have documents 
and life stuff like just getting a regular health checkup, I have family members I want to call, 
I have friends I want to hang out with more. Its mid February and I still haven't done any of anything 
I promised myself I would do.

You might ask, what am I actually doing all day then? Its simple. I try to avoid doing all of the things 
that I've decided I want to do and do everything else that's not on my list. I don't know how many people 
relate to this but once I put some pressure and try to force myself to do something, it never ever ever 
works. EVER. I never touch the task again unless I have deadlines. You could tell that all the tasks I 
mentioned above do not have deadlines and it's up to me to do it. 

I'm writing this blog not as a sign to show that I've figured out the solution to all my problems and 
I'm finally consistent and I'm doing everything perfectly. I've started writing this just as a start
to put some extra efforts to do the things I like to do. I figured that it would be easier for me 
to start this blog as a journal and to talk about myself and update my progress rather than jump into all 
the dreams I had for this blog. 

FYI, my english might be bad here but I DID NOT USE CHATGPT TO WRITE THIS. Adios
